# CQC

## This is the Repository for the Coffee, Quants and Codes group!

### Welcome to our collaborative space to share quantitative research and coding knowledge! To ensure a productive and respectful environment, here are our house rules:
* Stay on Topic: Share content related to quantitative research, coding in Stata, R, Python, and tips on software or courses. Keep discussions relevant and focused.
* Organize Contributions: Use the designated folders (e.g., /slides, /code, /tips) and clearly name your files to maintain structure and ease of navigation.
* Document Your Work: Include a README.md or comments in your code/slides to explain the purpose and usage of your contribution.
* Respect Open Source Etiquette: Avoid uploading copyrighted material unless you have explicit permission or it’s under an open-source license.
* Collaborate Thoughtfully: Before making major changes or adding large files, discuss with the group via issues or pull request comments.
* Give Credit: Acknowledge sources for any external content, tips, or ideas you share.
* Test Before Sharing: Ensure code is functional and slides are clear before uploading. Provide example data if applicable.
* Be Respectful: Foster a positive environment. Avoid harmful language or dismissive comments, and be supportive of all skill levels.
* Review Pull Requests: Actively review others’ contributions. Constructive feedback is welcome but should be professional and kind.
* Keep It Updated: If you find outdated resources or broken links, flag them or suggest replacements to keep the repository useful and current.

## Let’s make this repository a hub for learning, collaboration, and growth!
